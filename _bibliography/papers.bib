  title={Smart Shelf Advertising using Real-Time Product Segmentation and Interaction on Low-Cost Edge Devices},
  author={Owais Ahmed},
  abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive review of the work "A Dynamic Algorithm for Approximate Flow Computations" by Professor Prabhakar and Professor Viswanathan. The original paper introduces an algorithm that improves the efficiency of reachability analysis in linear dynamical systems by dynamically determining time intervals and using polynomial approximations to maintain a specified error bound. This review summarizes the key contributions, including the use of Bernstein polynomials and error control mechanisms, and critically evaluates the algorithmâ€™s performance, scalability, and limitations. Experimental insights, theoretical underpinnings, and potential directions for future research are discussed to highlight the broader implications of the work in formal verification and control systems.},
