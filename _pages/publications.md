## Publications & Preprints

### Using Large Language Models to Study Consumer Behavior: Review Algorithm Effects on Restaurant Selection
**Co-Author · In-Progress**

Working with Dr. Boram Lim (former Prof. @ University of Kansas) on a research project that uses AI agents powered by GPT models to simulate realistic customer decision-making in restaurant choice scenarios. The study explores how different review presentation algorithms (highest rated vs. most recent) and restaurant positioning (high-end vs. casual) affect consumer behavior. The system includes intelligent bias detection, dynamic review supplementation, and detailed behavioral logging.

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Consumer Behavior, AI Agents, Decision Making, Restaurant Industry

### Smart Shelf Advertising using Real-Time Product Segmentation and Interaction on Low-Cost Edge Devices
**Co-Author · Preprint**

Developed a real-time retail marketing system that intelligently detects product interaction and displays contextual advertisements on low-cost hardware. The system integrates Apriltag tracking, YOLOv8-based object segmentation, and Arduino-controlled lighting to detect when a product is picked and trigger the corresponding video ad. A custom YOLOv8 segmentation model trained on 3500+ images achieved 97.4% mAP@0.5, demonstrating robust real-time performance in retail deployments.

**Keywords:** Computer Vision, Edge Computing, Retail Technology, Object Detection, YOLOv8
