I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Sir Syed University of Engineering & Technology (SSUET) in Karachi, Pakistan. As a Software Engineer specializing in Backend development, AWS, and Cloud technologies, I am passionate about building scalable systems and exploring the frontiers of artificial intelligence.

Currently, along with my work, I'm engaged in an ongoing research project with <a href='https://scholarworks.bwise.kr/hanyang/researcher-profile?ep=1216'>Dr. Boram Lim</a> (former Prof. @ University of Kansas) on using Large Language Models to study consumer behavior, specifically exploring how different review algorithms affect restaurant selection decisions through AI agent simulations.

## Research Interests

I am passionate about **Natural Language Processing**, **Agentic AI**, and **Computer Vision**. My interests revolve around developing intelligent systems that can understand language, learn from data, and interact with the world in meaningful ways. I enjoy combining theory with practical applications and continue to explore research that bridges academic ideas with real world use cases.
